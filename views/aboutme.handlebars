<div id="intro-div">
    <p>I'M A WEB DEVELOPER BASED IN BERLIN, GERMANY<br>
    I build javascript applications and I'm comfortable developing on both frontend and backend.<br>
    Currently, I'm working with technologies like HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Vue, Node with Express and Postgresql. Although those are technologies I'm most comfortable with, I would welcome any opportunity to work with new languages and frameworks.<br>
    I build fully responsive web applications and I strive to make the web a better place with every line of code.</p>
